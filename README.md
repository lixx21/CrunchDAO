&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, I am here to share my repository about what I works in CrunchDAO, I want to share that every week I build machine learning model to forecast and predict finance market of CrunchDAO. I used several algorithm and model to build every week, Sometimes I just have to re-tuning the parameter of the algorithm. The algorithm that often used in this tournament is XGBOOST or GradientBoosting. The dataset will be share weekly from [CrunchDAO tournament] web(https://tournament.crunchdao.com/). The dataset is already cleaned and we just have to build the best model according to the dataset. **this repository I want to share my notebook about my model that I am using weekly in CrunchDAO tournament**.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CrunchDAO is a research team leveraging the power of collective intelligence and Web3 to produce next-generation financial predictions.
As a participant, you will be asked to build machine-learning models on the DAO's datasets. Members are remunerated in $CRUNCH according to the correlation of their predictions with the stock market over the following 90 days. The CrunchDAO's customers are paying the DAO for its financial forecasts. The data crunchers receive this payment according to their position on the leaderboards. You can see more about CrunchDAO in this link [CrunchDAO](https://www.crunchdao.com/) and the [CrucnhDAO' organization](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/crunch-dao).
